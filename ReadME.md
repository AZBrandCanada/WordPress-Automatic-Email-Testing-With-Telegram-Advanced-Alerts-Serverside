# WordPress-Automatic-Email-Testing-With-Telegram-Advanced-Alerts-Serverside

## Overview

This Python script is designed to monitor the email logs of various WordPress sites, checking their status and notifying you via Telegram if any issues are detected. It can automatically check the logs for specified websites and send alerts if any failures occur.
This Monitor Works In Conjunction With The Wordpress Plugin 
https://github.com/AZBrandCanada/Wordpress-Automatic-Email-Testing-With-Telegram-Alerts

## Features

- Monitor email logs from multiple WordPress sites.
- Send Telegram notifications on email failures.
- Check log files every 5 minutes.
- Alert every 5 seconds if:
  - A log file is older than 1 hour.
  - An email send fails.
  - A log file is missing or empty.
- Easy to add or remove websites from monitoring.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- requests library (can be installed via `pip install requests`)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the script to your server or local machine.

2. **Configure Log Files**:
   - Open the script file.
   - In the `log_files` dictionary, you can add as many websites as you want. Each entry should follow the format:
     ```
     "Website Name": "http://example.com/path/to/emaillog.txt"
     ```
   - For example:
     ```
     log_files = {
         "AZbrand.ca": "http://test.azbrand.ca/wp-content/plugins/emaillogger/emaillog.txt",
         "ExampleSite.ca": "https://examplesite.ca/htdocs/wp-content/plugins/emaillogger/emaillog.txt"
     }
     ```

3. **Set Up Telegram Bot**:
   - Create a new bot on Telegram by talking to BotFather.
   - After creating your bot, you'll receive a bot token. Replace `bot_token` in the script with your bot's token:
     ```
     bot_token = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
     ```
   - To find your chat ID, you can send a message to your bot and then access the following URL in your web browser:
     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
     ```
   - Look for the `"chat": {"id": ...}` section in the response and use this value to set `channel_id` in the script:
     ```
     channel_id = "YOUR_CHAT_ID"
     ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script using Python:
     ```
     python WordPress-Automatic-Email-Testing-With-Telegram-Advanced-Alerts-Serverside.py
     ```

## Adding to System Services (Linux)

To ensure the script runs continuously and restarts automatically on system reboots, you can add it to your system services. Here’s how to do it using `systemd`:

1. **Create a Service File**:
   - Open a terminal and create a new service file:
     ```
     sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/email-monitor.service
     ```

2. **Add the Following Configuration**:
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=WordPress Email Monitor

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/WordPress-Automatic-Email-Testing-With-Telegram-Advanced-Alerts-Serverside.py
   WorkingDirectory=/path/to/
   StandardOutput=journal
   StandardError=journal
   Restart=always

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
